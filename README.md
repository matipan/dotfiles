# Nix setup and config files

This repo holds my dotfiles and most recently my nix setup to use with home-manager.

For now I'm keeping all my "old" dotfiles (such as .zshrc and .tmux.conf) just in case. But I'm making an effort to migrate everything over to home-manager. There are a few quite opionionated things in home-manager's programs that I don't particularly like. But I can avoid those and simply configure it myself like I do with neovim.
